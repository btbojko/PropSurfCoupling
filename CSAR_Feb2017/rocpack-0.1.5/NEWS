2016-02-10 version 0.1.2

* Rewrite autotools build system

The build system was completely rewritten, and dependencies are not strictly
necessary anymore. The code can now be compiled with or without support for
OpenGL, PNG, and TIFF.

2015-09-06 version 0.1.1

* Add multi-page TIFF and new text output formats to pack2mesh
* Fix histogram initialization bug in rdf program

2015-01-19 version 0.1.0

* Build system moved to autotools

The build system has been moved to autotools to make compilation easier in
different systems. Compatibility with OS X has been lost due to development
that happened when I had no access to my Mac, but will be restored in the
future. The new build system will make porting to Windows easier too, if there
is a demand for it.

* Rocpack now reads some configuration files and imports shapes automatically

Rocpack now reads the user configuration file $HOME/.rocpack/config. This file
can only contain settings like set var = value; and shape definitions.

Rocpack now scans default directories and automatically imports shape files
in those directories. Currently, these directories are hard-coded in the code
to /usr/share/rocpack/shapes/ and $HOME/.rocpack/shapes/. Any shape files
placed in these directories will be automatically imported.

* Code clean ups

Some code clean ups were performed to prepare the code for builing with
autotools. If you notice that anything became broken due to the recent
updates, please report the bug to me at: guilherme.amadio@gmail.com.
