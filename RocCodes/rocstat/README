  RocStat is a small program to calculate statistics of packs in Amira
  file format. The usage and available options are below:

	rocstat - calculate statistics and create slices of pack files

	  Usage: rocstat [options] file.am

	  Options:

		-2	calculate two-point statistics

		-3	calculate three-point statistics

		-h	print help and exit

		-i	print info about input file

		-p	calculate packing fraction

		-s	create a slice file

		-v	view file on the screen

		-H	create hotspot locations inside particles (fraction is in
			the range of 0 to 100).

		-B	select the number of particle size bins (default = unset)

		-b	select the number of bins for the statistics calculations
			(default = 100)

		-d	maximum distance in microns for statistics calculations
			(default = 1/2 of the average of the pack dimensions)

		-n	number of random points per bin
			(default = 1000000 for 2-point and 200000 for 3-point statistics).

	  Examples:

	    Second order statistics:

	      $ rocstat -2 -b 50 -d 200 -n 30000 -o DCPD.sij DCPD.am

	    Third order statistics:

	      $ rocstat -3 -b 100 -d 150 -o DCPD.sijk DCPD.am

	    Packing fraction:

	      $ rocstat -p DCPD.am

	    Create an xy slice file for z=50

	      $ rocstat -s xy:50 DCPD.am > slice.dat

	    The slice types that the program recognizes are xy, xz and yz,
	    always followed by a colon and the number of the slice in the
	    missing variable, e.g., yz:10 for a yz slice and x=10.




	rocplot - script to make simple plots of data generated with rocstat

	  This program requires Python and Matplotlib to work. Please visit
	  http://www.python.org and http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net for more
	  information.

	  The program depends on the extensions of the files. Please make sure
	  that your statistics files have .sij and .sijk extentions for 2 and 3
	  point statistics files and .dat or .slice for slice files.

	  The script can be simply run as:

	    $ rocplot file.sij

	    $ rocplot file.sij S11

	    $ rocplot file.sijk S101

	  for statistics plots, and as:

	    $ rocplot file.slice
	    $ rocplot file.dat

	  for slice plots.

	  If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact the
	  authors.
